## Introduction

This repository serves as a companion to the [Machine Learning for Beginners YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNnGcZ1TWzPjKYWgfXSiWG). It contains:

- Jupyter notebooks with code examples.
- Datasets used in the tutorials.
- Exercises to practice your skills.
- Additional resources for further learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Familiarity with basic programming concepts is recommended.
